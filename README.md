# Hand Gesture Control System

**Hand Gesture Control System** is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning. It captures hand movements using a webcam and interprets gestures such as "Right," "Left," "Break," "MoveBack," and "Go." The system is powered by **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to allow intuitive control of devices or applications via hand gestures.
